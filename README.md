# Music-Visualizer

This is an audio visualization App, which currently only supports browsing and use in MATLAB appdesigner. The main function of this App is to play the imported music visually. The bar graph on the panel will change as the music is played. This App supports both single file import and entire folder import.

### How to open the App

1. Install MATLAB (my version is 2022b).
2. **Make sure** the two files are in the same path.
3. Lunch the appdesigner in MATLAB and open the file "MusicVisualizer.mlapp".
4. Click run to start.

### How to play with the App

- Click "Add" on the top left corner to add the music you like (supported extensions are ".ogg" ".mp3" ".wav" ".flac" ".au" ".aif" ".aiff" ".mp4" ".m4a").
- If you want to add an entire folder, just click "Add" and then click "Folder".
- The music will be listed on the left panel and you can double click it to play.
- Then you can see the visualized graph on the right.
- The play speed is also adjustable for customize use.
- Drag the progress bar to jump to the specified position in the music
